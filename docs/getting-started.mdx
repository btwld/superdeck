# Getting Started

Set up SuperDeck in your Flutter project and create your first presentation.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Flutter project (or create one with `flutter create my_presentation`)

## Installation

### 1. Install SuperDeck CLI

```bash
dart pub global activate superdeck_cli
```

### 2. Set up your project

In your Flutter project directory:

```bash
cd your-flutter-project
superdeck setup
```

This creates:
- Sample `slides.md` file
- Asset configuration in `pubspec.yaml`
- macOS entitlements for network access
- Custom `index.html` for web with loading indicator

### 3. Add SuperDeck dependency

```bash
flutter pub add superdeck
```

### 4. Initialize SuperDeck in your app

Update your `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:superdeck/superdeck.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await SuperDeckApp.initialize();
  runApp(
    SuperDeckApp(
      options: DeckOptions(
        debug: true, // Enable debug mode during development
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Your First Presentation

Edit the generated `slides.md` file:

```markdown
---
title: My First Presentation
---

# Welcome to SuperDeck!

This is your first slide.

---

## What is SuperDeck?

Create beautiful presentations using:

- Markdown for content
- Flutter for rendering
- Block-based layouts

---

## Two-Column Layout

```

## Build Your Presentation

```bash
# Build once
superdeck build

# Watch for changes (recommended)
superdeck build --watch
```

## Run Your App

```bash
flutter run
```

## Development Workflow

Use two terminals:

**Terminal 1** - Watch mode:
```bash
superdeck build --watch
```

**Terminal 2** - Flutter app:
```bash
flutter run
```

Edit `slides.md`, and the CLI rebuilds automatically. Hot reload Flutter to see changes.

## File Structure

After setup, your project will have:

```
your-flutter-project/
├── slides.md                 # Your presentation content
├── .superdeck/
│   ├── superdeck.json        # Generated presentation data
│   ├── assets/               # Generated assets
│   └── generated_assets.json # Asset references
├── pubspec.yaml              # Updated with asset configuration
└── lib/
    └── main.dart             # Your Flutter app
```

## Next Steps

- **[Block Layouts Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/block-layouts)** - Learn SuperDeck's layout system
- **[First Presentation Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/first-presentation)** - Create a complete presentation
- **[CLI Reference](/docs/guides/cli-reference)** - All CLI commands and options

## Troubleshooting

**Asset errors during build**
- Verify `pubspec.yaml` includes `.superdeck/assets/`
- Run `superdeck setup` to fix configuration

**SuperDeckApp.initialize() fails**
- Call `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` first
- Verify `slides.md` exists and is valid

**Changes not appearing**
- Confirm CLI watch mode is running
- Hot reload Flutter after rebuilds complete
