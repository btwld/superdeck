# Getting Started

This guide walks you through setting up SuperDeck in your Flutter project and creating your first presentation.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed
- Dart SDK installed
- A Flutter project (or create one with `flutter create my_presentation`)

## Installation

### 1. Install SuperDeck CLI

```bash
dart pub global activate superdeck_cli
```

### 2. Set up your Flutter project

Navigate to your Flutter project and run:

```bash
cd your-flutter-project
superdeck setup
```

This command:
- Creates a sample `slides.md` file
- Updates `pubspec.yaml` with asset configuration
- Sets up macOS entitlements for network access
- Configures custom `index.html` for web with loading indicator

### 3. Add SuperDeck dependency

```bash
flutter pub add superdeck
```

### 4. Initialize SuperDeck in your app

Update your `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:superdeck/superdeck.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await SuperDeckApp.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'My SuperDeck Presentation',
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      home: SuperDeckApp(
        options: DeckOptions(
          debug: true, // Enable debug mode during development
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Your First Presentation

The `superdeck setup` command creates a basic `slides.md` file. Edit it to create your first presentation:

```markdown
---
title: My First Presentation
---

# Welcome to SuperDeck!

This is your first slide.

---

## What is SuperDeck?

SuperDeck enables you to create beautiful presentations using:

- Markdown for content  
- Flutter for rendering
- Block-based layouts for flexibility

## Two-Column Layout

## Building Your Presentation

Build your slides using the CLI:

```bash
# Build once
superdeck build

# Build and watch for changes (recommended for development)
superdeck build --watch
```

## Running Your App

Now run your Flutter app:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Development Workflow

For the best development experience, use two terminals:

**Terminal 1** - CLI in watch mode:
```bash
superdeck build --watch
```

**Terminal 2** - Flutter app:
```bash
flutter run
```

Now when you edit `slides.md`, the CLI automatically rebuilds your presentation, and you can hot reload Flutter to see changes instantly.

## File Structure

After setup, your project will have:

```
your-flutter-project/
├── slides.md                 # Your presentation content
├── .superdeck/
│   ├── superdeck.json        # Generated presentation data
│   ├── assets/               # Generated assets
│   └── generated_assets.json # Asset references
├── pubspec.yaml              # Updated with asset configuration
└── lib/
    └── main.dart             # Your Flutter app
```

- **[First Presentation Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/first-presentation)** - Create a complete presentation
- **[CLI Reference](/docs/guides/cli-reference)** - All CLI commands and options

## Common Issues

**Build fails with asset errors?**
- Ensure your `pubspec.yaml` includes `.superdeck/assets/` in the assets section
- Run `superdeck setup` again to fix configuration

**SuperDeckApp.initialize() fails?**
- Make sure you call `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` first
- Check that your `slides.md` file exists and is valid

**Changes not showing?**
- Ensure CLI watch mode is running (`superdeck build --watch`)
- Hot reload Flutter after CLI rebuilds complete
