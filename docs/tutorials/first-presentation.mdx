# First Presentation Tutorial

This tutorial walks you through creating a complete presentation from scratch, introducing SuperDeck's key features along the way.

## What We'll Build

A presentation about Flutter development with:
- Title slide with centered content
- Multi-column layouts  
- Images and code examples
- Interactive DartPad embed
- Custom styling

## Prerequisites

- SuperDeck installed and set up ([Getting Started](/getting-started))
- Basic understanding of Markdown

## Step 1: Create the Title Slide

Start with a simple title slide in your `slides.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Flutter Development Essentials
---

@section

@column {
  align: "center"
}

# Flutter Development Essentials

## Building Beautiful Apps with Ease

**Your Name**  
*Today's Date*

---
```

**Build and test:**
```bash
superdeck build --watch
flutter run
```

## Step 2: Add Content Slides

Add slides introducing Flutter concepts:

```markdown
## What is Flutter?

@section

@column {
  flex: 2
}

Flutter is Google's **UI toolkit** for building natively compiled applications for:

- 📱 Mobile (iOS & Android)
- 🌐 Web  
- 🖥️ Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- 📺 Embedded devices

@column

---
```

## Step 3: Multi-Column Layout

Create a features comparison slide:

```markdown
## Why Choose Flutter?

@section

@column

### ⚡ Performance
- Native performance
- 60fps animations
- Direct GPU rendering

### 🎨 Beautiful UI  
- Material Design
- Cupertino widgets
- Custom styling

@column

### 🔥 Hot Reload
- Instant updates
- Preserve app state  
- Fast iteration

### 🌍 Single Codebase
- Write once, run everywhere
- Shared business logic
- Consistent user experience

---
```

## Step 4: Add Code Examples

Include syntax-highlighted code:

```markdown
## Your First Flutter App

@section

@column

Here's a simple Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hello Flutter')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

@column

### Key Concepts:
- **Widgets** - Everything is a widget
- **MaterialApp** - App structure
- **Scaffold** - Page layout
- **StatelessWidget** - Immutable widgets

---
```

## Step 5: Interactive Content

Add a DartPad for live coding:

```markdown
## Try It Yourself

@section

@column

Experiment with this Flutter code:

- Modify the text
- Change colors
- Add more widgets

@column {
  flex: 2
}

@dartpad {
  id: "your_dartpad_id"
  theme: "dark"
  run: true
}

---
```

**Note:** Replace `your_dartpad_id` with an actual DartPad ID from [dartpad.dev](https://dartpad.dev).

## Step 6: Image Showcase

Create a visual slide:

```markdown
## Flutter in Action

@section

@column

### Popular Apps Built with Flutter:

- **Google Ads**
- **Alibaba**  
- **BMW**
- **Nubank**
- **Tencent**

@image {
  asset: "https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/showcase/showcase-montage.jpg"
  fit: "cover"
  flex: 2
}

---
```

## Step 7: Call-to-Action Slide

End with next steps:

```markdown
## Get Started Today!

@section

@column {
  align: "center"
}

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first presentation:

- **[Block Types Reference](/docs/reference/block-types)** - Learn all block types
- **[CLI Reference](/docs/guides/cli-reference)** - Master the CLI tools  
- **[Styling Guide](/docs/guides/styling-guide)** - Customize appearance
- **[Examples](/examples)** - See more real-world examples

## Tips for Great Presentations

1. **Keep slides focused** - One concept per slide
2. **Use visuals** - Images and code examples enhance understanding  
3. **Test early** - Use watch mode for rapid iteration
4. **Practice navigation** - Test keyboard and touch controls
5. **Consider your audience** - Adjust content complexity accordingly
